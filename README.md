# Salt-Hash Approximation Recovery-attack with Known plaintext using data containers (Hashcat)
> :warning: **Disclaimer**: PLEASE BE AWARE THAT THE VULNERABILITY HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AND SUCCESSFULLY CLOSED.
NO KNOWN ATTACKS HAVE BEEN EXECUTED USING THIS VULNERABILITY AND NO DATA WAS OBTAINABLE BY THIRD PARTIES.
THE INFORMATION PRESENTED IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND DOES NOT REPRESENT AN ONGOING RISK.

This is a demonstrative recovery attack with which any low privilege user of the system
can potentially steal user credentials and perform actions using a different identity,
this works by exploiting the password reset feature shortly after a finished update cycle
in combination with data containers for the attacker to map possible prng sequences to salts for hash predictions.

## Summary
  1. Remove nearby hash salts by iteration of lcg parameters with known points in sequence
  2. Fire and forget guessed unsalted hashes based on lcg sequence via cloud compute services
  3. Copyright

### CWE-338 Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)
Uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) in a security context, but the PRNG's algorithm is not cryptographically strong.

```c

rlcg<a, c, m, /*second modulo*/0> rlcg({p1, p2});

### CWE-760 Use of a One-Way Hash with a Predictable Salt
One-way cryptographic hash against an input that should not be reversible, such as a password, but uses a predictable salt as part of the input.
